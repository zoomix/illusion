Illusion watchface
==================

This is a custom watchface for the Pebble smart watch. [Download it][0].

It looks like this:

It's darker version of the illusion watchface by [dmnd][2], originally by
[Tokyo Flash][1]. I find it's a better fit for my black pebble.

Although it may not be immediately apparent, there are 4 large numbers on this
face. It works by having a background of lines going one direction, while
another layer has lines in the other direction. The number digits change the
direction of the lines.

Thanks to [dmnd][2] for the code. I just touched a file. =]
